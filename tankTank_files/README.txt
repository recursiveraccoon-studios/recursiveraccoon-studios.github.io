Hi! Thank you for testing my game!

This is TANK!TANK, a simple arcade shooter.

Your objective is to defend the base in the middle of the screen.

Move the tank with
W = ^
A = <
S = v
D = >
[spacebar] = fire

Difficulty levels:
1: Can shoot through the base
2: The base stops your shells
3: Your shells damage the base
